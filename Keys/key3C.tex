This is the Answer Key for Module 3 Version C.

11. Using an interval or intervals, describe all the $x$-values within or including a distance of the given values.
$$ \text{ No more than } 3 \text{ units from the number } 1. $$ 
The solution is $ [-2, 4] $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [2, 4] $ 

 Corresponds to flipping which number is the 'center' and how far away we are counting from the center number. 
\item $ [-2, 4] $ 

 * Correct option. 
\item $ (-2, 4) $ 

 Corresponds to not including the endpoints. 
\item $ (2, 4) $ 

 Corresponds to flipping the numbers AND not including the endpoints. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: No more than translates to within. So, we are looking for all the numbers within a certain number.

-----------------------------------------------

12. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ 6 - 8 x \leq -6 x + 3 $$ 
The solution is $ [1.5, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-1, 8] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [-1.4, 2.3] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality AND the negative of the actual solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [-4, 1] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality (wrong direction). 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-4.7, -0.2] $ 

 Corresponds to the negative of the actual solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less than or equal to includes the endpoint!

-----------------------------------------------

13. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ \frac{3}{8} + \frac{6}{5} x > \frac{10}{6} x - \frac{10}{7} $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, 3.865) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [3, 5] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-5, -2] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality AND getting the negative of the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [-4, -1] $ 

 Corresponds to getting the negative of the solution. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [1, 6] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality. 
\item $ \text{There is no solution to the inequality.} $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less than or equal to includes the endpoint. Also, when multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign.

-----------------------------------------------

14. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -4 + 6 x > 8 x \text{ or } 7 + 9 x < 10 x $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, -2.0) \text{ or } (7.0, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-9, -5] \text{ and } b \in [-4, 5] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality and negating the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-6, 0] \text{ and } b \in [4, 9] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints (when they should be excluded). 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-5, 4] \text{ and } b \in [5, 9] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-11, -5] \text{ and } b \in [1, 6] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints AND negating. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: When multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign.

-----------------------------------------------

15. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -6 - 5 x < \frac{-18 x + 7}{4} \leq -5 - 6 x $$ 
The solution is $ (-15.5, -4.5] $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [-16, -15] \text{ and } b \in [-8, -4] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints. 
\item $ (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [2, 8] \text{ and } b \in [8, 19] $ 

 Corresponds to negating and inverting the inequality. 
\item $ (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [-17, -13] \text{ and } b \in [-7, -3] $ 

  * This is the correct solution. 
\item $ [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [2, 5] \text{ and } b \in [15, 18] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints AND inverting the inequality. 
\item $ \text{There is no solution to the inequality.} $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
To solve, you will need to break up the compound inequality into two inequalities. Be sure to keep track of the inequality! It may be best to draw a number line and graph your solution.
