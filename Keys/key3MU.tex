This is the Answer Key for Module 3 Version MU.

11. Using an interval or intervals, describe all the $x$-values within or including a distance of the given values.
$$ \text{ No more than } 9 \text{ units from the number } 2. $$ 
The solution is $ [-7, 11] $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-7, 11) $ 

 Corresponds to not including the endpoints. 
\item $ [-7, 11] $ 

 * Correct option. 
\item $ (7, 11) $ 

 Corresponds to flipping the numbers AND not including the endpoints. 
\item $ [7, 11] $ 

 Corresponds to flipping which number is the 'center' and how far away we are counting from the center number. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: No more than translates to within. So, we are looking for all the numbers within a certain number.

12. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -6 - 8 x \leq 5 x + 5 $$ 
The solution is $ [-0.846, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [-1.59, -0.03] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality AND the negative of the actual solution. 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-3, 0.4] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [0.6, 1.1] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality (wrong direction). 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-0.04, 0.99] $ 

 Corresponds to the negative of the actual solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less than or equal to includes the endpoint!

-----------------------------------------------

13. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ \frac{-8}{3} - \frac{6}{4} x > \frac{-4}{7} x - \frac{7}{6} $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, -1.615) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-1, 6] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality AND getting the negative of the solution. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-5, 1] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [-5, 0] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [0, 3] $ 

 Corresponds to getting the negative of the solution. 
\item $ \text{There is no solution to the inequality.} $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less than or equal to includes the endpoint. Also, when multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign.

-----------------------------------------------

14. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -4 + 3 x > 5 x \text{ or } 6 + 3 x < 5 x $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, -2.0) \text{ or } (3.0, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-5.9, -2.2] \text{ and } b \in [1.2, 2.3] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints AND negating. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-2.6, -0.3] \text{ and } b \in [2.36, 3.45] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-3.9, -2.4] \text{ and } b \in [1.66, 2.21] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality and negating the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-2.5, -0.2] \text{ and } b \in [2.9, 3.4] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints (when they should be excluded). 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: When multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign.

-----------------------------------------------

15. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -4 + 4 x < \frac{31 x - 9}{7} \leq 4 + 4 x $$ 
The solution is $ (-6.333, 12.333] $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [-7, -4] \text{ and } b \in [7, 14] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints. 
\item $ (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [-17, -11] \text{ and } b \in [4, 8] $ 

 Corresponds to negating and inverting the inequality. 
\item $ [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [-14, -12] \text{ and } b \in [5, 8] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints AND inverting the inequality. 
\item $ (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [-12, -6] \text{ and } b \in [9, 17] $ 

  * This is the correct solution. 
\item $ \text{There is no solution to the inequality.} $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
To solve, you will need to break up the compound inequality into two inequalities. Be sure to keep track of the inequality! It may be best to draw a number line and graph your solution.
