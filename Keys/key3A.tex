This is the Answer Key for Module 3 Version A.

11. Using an interval or intervals, describe all the $x$-values within or including a distance of the given values.
$$ \text{ No more than } 4 \text{ units from the number } -7. $$ 
The solution is $ [-11, -3] $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [-11, -3] $ 

 * Correct option. 
\item $ (-3, 11) $ 

 Corresponds to flipping the numbers AND not including the endpoints. 
\item $ (-11, -3) $ 

 Corresponds to not including the endpoints. 
\item $ [-3, 11] $ 

 Corresponds to flipping which number is the 'center' and how far away we are counting from the center number. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: No more than translates to within. So, we are looking for all the numbers within a certain number.

-----------------------------------------------

12. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ 10 - 10 x \leq 3 x + 5 $$ 
The solution is $ [0.385, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-0.1, 1] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-3, -0.2] $ 

 Corresponds to the negative of the actual solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [-1.6, -0.2] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality (wrong direction). 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [0, 3.6] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality AND the negative of the actual solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less than or equal to includes the endpoint!

-----------------------------------------------

13. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ \frac{6}{2} + \frac{5}{3} x > \frac{7}{6} x + \frac{4}{5} $$ 
The solution is $ (-4.4, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [0, 6] $ 

 Corresponds to getting the negative of the solution. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-6, 0] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [-9, -3] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [2, 7] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality AND getting the negative of the solution. 
\item $ \text{There is no solution to the inequality.} $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less than or equal to includes the endpoint. Also, when multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign.

-----------------------------------------------

14. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -8 + 3 x > 6 x \text{ or } 3 + 9 x < 11 x $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, -2.667) \text{ or } (1.5, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-1.71, -1.46] \text{ and } b \in [2.38, 3.67] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints AND negating. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-2.3, -0.1] \text{ and } b \in [2.03, 3.28] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality and negating the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-3.7, -1.8] \text{ and } b \in [1.03, 1.64] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-2.85, -2.32] \text{ and } b \in [1.24, 1.88] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints (when they should be excluded). 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: When multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign.

-----------------------------------------------

15. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -6 + 7 x < \frac{65 x - 3}{9} \leq 9 + 4 x $$ 
The solution is $ (-25.5, 2.897] $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [-28, -22] \text{ and } b \in [2, 11] $ 

  * This is the correct solution. 
\item $ [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [-5, -1] \text{ and } b \in [22, 28] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints AND inverting the inequality. 
\item $ [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [-29, -24] \text{ and } b \in [0, 4] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints. 
\item $ (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [-3, 0] \text{ and } b \in [22, 31] $ 

 Corresponds to negating and inverting the inequality. 
\item $ \text{There is no solution to the inequality.} $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
To solve, you will need to break up the compound inequality into two inequalities. Be sure to keep track of the inequality! It may be best to draw a number line and graph your solution.
