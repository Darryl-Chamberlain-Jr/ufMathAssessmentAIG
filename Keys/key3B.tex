This is the Answer Key for Module 3 Version B.

11. Using an interval or intervals, describe all the $x$-values within or including a distance of the given values.
$$ \text{ No more than } 4 \text{ units from the number } -2. $$ 
The solution is $ [-6, 2] $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [2, 6] $ 

 Corresponds to flipping which number is the 'center' and how far away we are counting from the center number. 
\item $ [-6, 2] $ 

 * Correct option. 
\item $ (-6, 2) $ 

 Corresponds to not including the endpoints. 
\item $ (2, 6) $ 

 Corresponds to flipping the numbers AND not including the endpoints. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: No more than translates to within. So, we are looking for all the numbers within a certain number.

-----------------------------------------------

12. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ 3 - 4 x \leq 10 x + 6 $$ 
The solution is $ [-0.214, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [-0.52, 0.11] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality AND the negative of the actual solution. 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-0.22, 0.08] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [0.2, 0.54] $ 

 Corresponds to the negative of the actual solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [-0, 0.38] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality (wrong direction). 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less than or equal to includes the endpoint!

-----------------------------------------------

13. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ \frac{-9}{9} - \frac{10}{7} x > \frac{-8}{6} x - \frac{4}{8} $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, -5.25) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [3, 7] $ 

 Corresponds to getting the negative of the solution. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [3, 8] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality AND getting the negative of the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [-8, -3] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-7, -1] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality. 
\item $ \text{There is no solution to the inequality.} $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less than or equal to includes the endpoint. Also, when multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign.

-----------------------------------------------

14. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ 4 + 7 x > 10 x \text{ or } 7 + 4 x < 7 x $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, 1.333) \text{ or } (2.333, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-1, 4] \text{ and } b \in [0, 6] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints (when they should be excluded). 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-6, -1] \text{ and } b \in [-6, 0] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints AND negating. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-1.1, 2.4] \text{ and } b \in [0.8, 2.9] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-2.5, -1.6] \text{ and } b \in [-3, -1.1] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality and negating the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: When multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign.

-----------------------------------------------

15. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ 6 + 9 x < \frac{38 x - 4}{4} \leq 8 + 9 x $$ 
The solution is $ (14.0, 18.0] $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [12, 17] \text{ and } b \in [13, 22] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints. 
\item $ [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [-20, -13] \text{ and } b \in [-16, -12] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints AND inverting the inequality. 
\item $ (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [13, 15] \text{ and } b \in [17, 19] $ 

  * This is the correct solution. 
\item $ (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [-23, -14] \text{ and } b \in [-17, -10] $ 

 Corresponds to negating and inverting the inequality. 
\item $ \text{There is no solution to the inequality.} $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
To solve, you will need to break up the compound inequality into two inequalities. Be sure to keep track of the inequality! It may be best to draw a number line and graph your solution.
