# ufMathAssessmentAIG
Repository corresponding to my talk "Creating diagnostic assessments: Automated distractor generation with integrity" at the 2019 Assessment Conference hosted by UF.

This repository contains example code used to generate exams for MAC 1105 (Basic College Algebra) during Spring 2019. This is a work-in-progress and by no means a finished product. For those new to SageMath, this repository contains examples to help you prepare your own exams in SageMath.

Course for Spring 2019:
